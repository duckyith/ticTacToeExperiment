# ticTacToeExperiment
When against an opponent who always sees forced moves and otherwise plays randomly, what sequence of moves in tic tac toe gives you the best chance of winning? This project seeks to answer that question.

## Basic Game and AI
The game is functional, played in terminal by running the Play executable.

Functionality includes:
- Printed array to show played X's and O's and un-played spaces
- User input 0-8 to play an X (including first move)
- Incorrect and out of range input detection
- Built in quit command
- AI response that plays randomly or recognizes forced moves and blocks/wins

Planned:
[] Modified play option to run game fast without user input or prints
[] Ability to play itself using the same set moves to try all combinations a set number of times
[] Recognizing when gameplay doesn't need to continue (ends in tie)
[] Tracking statistics for most efficient gameplay
[] Analysis of statistics
